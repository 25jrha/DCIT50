# Midterms Lab Examination

## Objectives
- Apply OOP concepts in Java including class inheritance, method overloading, and static variables.
- Implement modular and maintainable Java code.
- Model real-world objects and their interactions.
- Demonstrate use of constructors, `this` keyword, and arrays of objects.

## Functionality
